Description: To footprint the binding of transcription factors on DNA, the traditional motif mapping analysis requires previously curated motifs, and is limited to profile only 1 motif at a time. To overcome such issues, this package provides the implementation of the mutual-infomation based footprint analysis for transcription factors.
